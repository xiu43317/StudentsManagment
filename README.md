# StudentsManagment
This is a student management system. I use this to practice my SPA skills. I uses js's xmlhttprequest to fetch php's responesible data from Mysql database. It works very well on my localhost server. Unfortunately I put this code on my free website, it has not responsible reactions. I guess it is the response is too slow from the database and web site can't catch the updated data immedately. However it still can work on the local server, and I will keep tring to figure how to improve the situation. When using the website to add new data and delete old data, you need to push the F5 to refresh the website. Interestingly when updating the new data, it works very well with SPA. That is I used php to render the page to xmlhttprequest's responsible data. For delete and add functions, I just caculated the page number and passed it to index page to renew the page. It seems not working by this way.
